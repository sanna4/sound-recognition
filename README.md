The task of this project is to implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can classify with high precision a bunch of musical instruments, using some features extracted 
from some audio files, which are in dataset.zip.

You may need to change something in the notebook before execution, like the position of the files/directories implemented.
Some Python libraries (Librosa, python_speech_features, ...) may not be included in your notebook environment. Check docs in the links below:

Librosa : https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html <br>
python_speech_features: https://python-speech-features.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

If any other error occurs, check docs for that library.
